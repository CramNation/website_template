        <p class="pb-3" id="spaced-text">
        Binding Arbitration
        
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity
        or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the
        European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a
        result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this clause.
        
        Restrictions
        
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
        extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
        authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
        public or any other persons.
        
        Exceptions to Arbitration
        
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration:
        (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
        of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
        unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
        then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
        or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
        jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
