        The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other
        websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any
        third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the

        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
        in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
        until deletion is possible.

        measures.
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
        transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect

        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at

        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
        consent.
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal

        <h5 class="p-0">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>
        <p class="pb-3" id="spaced-text">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
        the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        information.
        
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California
        residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
        information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
        California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
        information provided below.

        contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and
        a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Website, but
        please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups,
        etc.).
        How do we use and share your personal information?
        More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this privacy notice.
        You can opt out from the selling of your personal information by disabling cookies in Cookie Preference Settings and

        Will your information be shared with anyone else?
        We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each
        service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.
        The current list of our service providers can be found in below.
        We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for
        technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal data.

        commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months:

        Your rights with respect to your personal data
        Right to request deletion of the data - Request to delete
        You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will
        respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but
        not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements
        resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.
        Right to be informed - Request to know
        Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:
        whether we collect and use your personal information;
        the categories of personal information that we collect;
        the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
        whether we sell your personal information to third parties;
        the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
        the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
        the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.
        In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified
        in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.
        Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
        We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
        Verification process
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we
        have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we
        can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
        submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
        information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you
        have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If,
        however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention
        purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
        Other privacy rights
        you may object to the processing of your personal data
        you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the
        processing of the data
        you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an
        authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance
        with the CCPA.
        you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request
        to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the
        request submission.
        To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at cramnationsite@gmail.com, or by referring to the contact
        details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear
